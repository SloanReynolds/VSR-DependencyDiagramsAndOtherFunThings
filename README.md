# VSR-DependencyDiagramsAndOtherFunThings
Personal Utility libraries for development of the VSR Item Rando

This houses a couple of utility funcitons I used to better make the VSR Item Randomizer. Automated dependency diagrams to help trim the fat or see where I had doubled up on things. An excel bridge to help keep data collected from people playing the game via a web API in one place and simplify the logic strings that are used to validate the randomized states the game can be placed in.
